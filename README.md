# First-Portfolio
First Portfolio Website made using HTML and CSS with some JavaScript

Start - May 20, 2021:


This was done in an effort to showcase my ability to adjust to new languages, 
as I am unfamiliar with both CSS and JavaScript. On top of this, I didn't use HTML since before
my time at Rutgers University. 


Update: June 06, 2021:
After long weeks of figuring out what I want to put in this site and how to make that happen, I believe I finished most of what I wanted to achieve with this First Portfolio. The images and layout of everything potrays my personality and hobbies while also showcasing what I have done throughout my time at Rutgers as well as what I am capable of. I will admit I started this project using a YouTube template but it was after the developement of the ".is()" section that I put my own spin onto certain things. I really hope this will help in my endeavor in getting my first job in the Computer Engineering industry. I also recognize that this might seem like something that should not have taken that long, but I wanted to be content with what I use as a portfolio site while also learning the most on top of working part time and looking for a job relevant to my major.

Access The Site at https://nayaabc.github.io/nayaab.is/ (NO LONGER A WORK IN PROGRESS, INSTEAD I WILL LEAVE THIS AS THE FIRST PORTFOLIO SITE I MADE USING HTML/CSS/JS).
